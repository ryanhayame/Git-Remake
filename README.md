# Git-Remake
## Designed and implemented a local version-control software that mimics features of Git
#### - Developed a custom blob-tree-commit storage system using various data structures
      - Utilized hashsets, treemaps, and arraylists
#### - Utilized persistence, serialization, and SHA1 hashing to save contents of files
#### - Supports:
      1. Adding/removing a copy of a file to a staging area (adding/removing)
      3. Saving a snapshot of tracked files in the current commit and staging area (committing)
      4. Maintaining related sequences of commits (branches)
      5. Restoring a version of one or more files, or entire commits (checking out)
      6. Viewing the history of previous commits or all commits ever made (log)
      7. Listing all staged files, removed files, and branches (status)
      9. Merging changes made in one branch into another (merging)
